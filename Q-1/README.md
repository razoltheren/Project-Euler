Q-1 of the Project-Euler problems
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Approach:
Create three functions wherein we find out sums of multiples of 3. 5 and 15. Note that while summing the multiples of 3 and 5, multiples of 15 get summed twice, hence subtract the multiples of 15 from the sum.
